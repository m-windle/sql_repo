# SQL Scripts

Accessing databases is a necessary skill to have. 
I have learned how to access and build databases using Oracle SQL and what is posted here are assigments and tests for the class. 

Learning SQL for me is not limited to this class but is integrated within my other object oriented projects. As such, there will not be as many purely SQL based samples posted here.
